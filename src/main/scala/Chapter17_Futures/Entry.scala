  A block of code wrapped in a Future { ... } executes concurrently
  A future succeeds with a result or fails with an exception.
  You can wait for a future to complete, but you don't usually want to.
  You can use callbacks to get notified when a future completes, but that get tedious when chaining callbacks.
  A promises has a future whose value can be set (once), which gives added flexibility for implementing tasks that produce results.
  Pick an execution context that is suitable for the concurrent workload of your computation.

  /*
  EXERCISES 8
  Write a program that asks the user for a URL,
  reads the web page at that URL,
  and displays all the hyperlinks.
  Use a separate Future for each of these three steps.

  EXERCISES 9
  Write a program that asks the user for a URL, reads the web page at that URL,
  finds all the hyperlinks, visits each of them concurrently,
  and locates the Server HTTP header for each of them.
  Finally, print a table of which servers were found how often.
  The futures that visit each page should return the header.

  EXERCISES 10
  Change the preceding exercise where the futures that visit each header update a shared Java ConcurrentHashMap
  or Scala TrieMap. This isnâ€™t as easy as it sounds. A threadsafe data structure is safe in the sense that you
  cannot corrupt its implementation,
  but you have to make sure that sequences of reads and updates are atomic.

  EXERCISES 11
  Using futures, run four tasks that each sleep for ten seconds and then print the current time.
  If you have a reasonably modern computer,
  it is very likely that it reports four available processors to the JVM,
  and the futures should all complete at around the same time.
  Now repeat with forty tasks.
  What happens? Why? Replace the execution context with a cached thread pool.
  What happens now? (Be careful to define the futures after replacing the implicit execution context.)

  EXERCISES 12
  Write a method that, given a URL, locates all hyperlinks, makes a promise for each of them,
  starts a task in which it will eventually fulfill all promises,
  and returns a sequence of futures for the promises.
  Why would it not be a good idea to return a sequence of promises?
   */

  /*
  EXERCISES 13
  Use a promise for implementing cancellation. Given a range of big integers,
  split the range into subranges that you concurrently search for palindromic primes.
  When such a prime is found, set it as the value of the future.
  All tasks should periodically check whether the promise is completed,
  in which case they should terminate.
